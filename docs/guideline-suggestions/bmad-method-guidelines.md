# BMAD Method Guidelines Suggestions

## Overview
Based on the successful implementation of the template-health-endpoint project, these suggestions enhance the existing .augment-guidelines to better support complex software development projects.

## Suggested Additions to .augment-guidelines

### 1. Systematic Methodology Section

**Add to "Planning" section:**

```markdown
## Systematic Development Methodology

For complex projects, follow the BMAD Method workflow:

1. **Analyst Phase**: Create comprehensive project brief with problem analysis
2. **Product Manager Phase**: Develop detailed PRD with epics and user stories  
3. **Architect Phase**: Design technical architecture and component structure
4. **Product Owner Phase**: Validate requirements and create acceptance criteria
5. **Scrum Master Phase**: Break epics into 5-task manageable stories
6. **Developer Phase**: Implement with incremental progress and validation

**Quality Gates**: Complete each phase before proceeding to ensure proper foundation.
```

### 2. Incremental Development Guidelines

**Add to "Making edits" section:**

```markdown
## Incremental Development Approach

When implementing complex features:

1. **Break into 5 Small Changes**: Each story should have exactly 5 focused changes
2. **Validate Each Change**: Test and verify each change before proceeding
3. **Maintain Working State**: Ensure system remains functional after each change
4. **Document Progress**: Update status and document decisions at each step
5. **Quality First**: "Keep going until everything works and you think you did a great job"

**Change Size Guidelines**:
- Each change should be completable in 10-15 minutes
- Focus on single responsibility per change
- Include testing and validation in each change
- Document rationale for complex decisions
```

### 3. Schema-First Development

**Add new section:**

```markdown
## Schema-First Development

For API and data-driven projects:

1. **Define Schemas First**: Use TypeSpec, JSON Schema, or similar for API definitions
2. **Generate Code**: Use schema-driven code generation for consistency
3. **Multi-Language Support**: Generate clients and servers from single schema
4. **Validation Integration**: Include schema validation in generated code
5. **Documentation Generation**: Auto-generate API documentation from schemas

**Benefits**: Ensures consistency, reduces errors, enables multi-language support
```

### 4. Progressive Complexity Patterns

**Add new section:**

```markdown
## Progressive Complexity Implementation

For systems with multiple use cases:

1. **Tier Structure**: Design Basic → Intermediate → Advanced → Enterprise tiers
2. **Clear Value Proposition**: Each tier should provide obvious value over previous
3. **Feature Flags**: Use configuration-driven feature enablement
4. **Upgrade Paths**: Provide clear migration between tiers
5. **Time Targets**: Set realistic deployment time goals for each tier

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Start with simplest tier that provides value
- Build complexity incrementally
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Test upgrade paths thoroughly
```

### 5. CLI Tool Development Standards

**Add new section:**

```markdown
## CLI Tool Development

When building developer tools:

1. **Framework Choice**: Use Cobra for Go CLI tools, similar frameworks for other languages
2. **Configuration Management**: Support YAML/JSON config files with environment overrides
3. **User Experience**: Include help, verbose mode, dry-run capabilities
4. **Error Handling**: Provide clear, actionable error messages
5. **Template System**: Use language-native templating for code generation

**Quality Requirements**:
- Comprehensive help documentation
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Colored output for better UX
- Configuration validation with helpful suggestions
```

### 6. Testing and Validation Framework

**Add to "Testing" section:**

```markdown
## Comprehensive Testing Strategy

Implement multi-level testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Validate component interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
4. **Generated Code Tests**: Validate generated code compiles and runs
5. **Real-World Validation**: Test in actual deployment environments

**Validation Requirements**:
- Schema validation for all definitions
- Performance benchmarking against requirements
- Security scanning and compliance checking
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- Documentation accuracy verification
```

### 7. Handoff Documentation Standards

**Add new section:**

```markdown
## AI Agent Handoff Documentation

For complex projects requiring handoff:

1. **Complete Context**: Include mission, current status, and architecture
2. **Working Verification**: Document what's working with test results
3. **Next Steps**: Provide prioritized task list with clear requirements
4. **Getting Started**: Include immediate actionable commands
5. **Quality Standards**: Define success criteria and requirements

**Handoff Document Structure**:
- Mission statement and objectives
- Current status with completion percentages
- Verified working features with examples
- Prioritized next steps with acceptance criteria
- Technical reference and troubleshooting guide
```

### 8. Quality Standards Enhancement

**Enhance existing quality section:**

```markdown
## Enhanced Quality Standards

**Code Generation Quality**:
- Generated code must compile without errors
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Include testing frameworks and examples
- Generate complete project structures

**Performance Requirements**:
- API endpoints must respond within specified timeframes
- Template generation should complete within reasonable time
- Generated applications should meet performance benchmarks
- Resource usage should be optimized

**Documentation Standards**:
- Include working examples and verification steps
- Provide clear setup and usage instructions
- Document architectural decisions and rationale
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues
```

### 9. Technology Stack Guidelines

**Add new section:**

```markdown
## Technology Stack Selection

**Proven Combinations**:
- **API Development**: TypeSpec + Go + TypeScript for multi-language consistency
- **CLI Tools**: Go + Cobra + Viper for robust command-line interfaces
- **Container Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes with proper health probes
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring
- **Testing**: Language-native frameworks + integration testing

**Selection Criteria**:
- Maturity and community support
- Integration capabilities
- Performance characteristics
- Learning curve and documentation
- Long-term maintenance considerations
```

### 10. Project Organization Standards

**Enhance existing structure guidelines:**

```markdown
## Enhanced Project Organization

**Directory Structure**:
```
project/
├── cmd/                    # CLI applications and entry points
├── pkg/                    # Reusable packages and libraries
├── internal/               # Private application code
├── docs/                   # Comprehensive documentation
│   ├── prompts/           # Reusable prompt templates
│   ├── learnings/         # Project learnings and insights
│   ├── stories/           # BMAD Method user stories
│   └── guideline-suggestions/ # Process improvement suggestions
├── examples/              # Working examples and demonstrations
├── scripts/               # Build and utility scripts
└── tests/                 # Test suites and fixtures
```
