# Story 1.2: Design Core TypeSpec Health Schemas

## Status: Complete âœ…

## Story

- As a developer
- I want comprehensive TypeSpec schemas for health endpoints
- so that I can generate consistent APIs across all template tiers with proper type safety

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. TypeSpec models for HealthStatus, ServerTime, and ServerTimingMetrics are defined
2. TypeSpec interfaces for health, time, ready, and live endpoints are created
3. CloudEvents schema integration for health status changes is implemented
4. JSON Schema and OpenAPI v3 generation from TypeSpec definitions is validated
5. All schemas support progressive complexity across four template tiers

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create core health status models (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Define HealthStatus model with status, timestamp, version, uptime
  - [ ] Create ServerTime model with comprehensive timestamp formats
  - [ ] Design ServerTimingMetrics model for performance data
  - [ ] Add DependencyStatus model for external service checks
  - [ ] Include proper TypeSpec decorators and constraints

- [ ] Task 2: Design health endpoint interfaces (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create Health interface with GET endpoints
  - [ ] Define route decorators for /health, /health/time, /health/ready, /health/live
  - [ ] Add proper HTTP method decorators and response types
  - [ ] Include error response models and status codes
  - [ ] Design extensible interface for dependency endpoints

- [ ] Task 3: Implement CloudEvents integration schemas (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create HealthEvent model following CloudEvents v1.0 specification
  - [ ] Define HealthStatusChangeData for event payloads
  - [ ] Add event type definitions and source patterns
  - [ ] Include trace ID correlation for observability
  - [ ] Design event schemas for dependency failures and recovery

- [ ] Task 4: Validate schema generation capabilities (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test TypeSpec compilation and validation
  - [ ] Generate JSON Schema from TypeSpec models
  - [ ] Generate OpenAPI v3 specification from interfaces
  - [ ] Validate generated schemas against reference implementation
  - [ ] Test schema compatibility with Go and TypeScript generation

- [ ] Task 5: Design tier-specific schema variations (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create basic tier schema subset (minimal health + ServerTime)
  - [ ] Design intermediate tier additions (dependencies, basic observability)
  - [ ] Plan advanced tier extensions (full observability, CloudEvents)
  - [ ] Define enterprise tier features (compliance, security, audit)
  - [ ] Document schema evolution and backward compatibility strategy

## Dev Technical Guidance

**TypeSpec Schema Organization:**
- Place schemas in `pkg/schemas/health/` directory structure
- Use separate files for logical grouping: `health.tsp`, `server-time.tsp`, `cloudevents.tsp`
- Follow TypeSpec naming conventions and import patterns
- Reference `docs/architecture.md#data-models--schemas` for target structure

**Schema Design Principles:**
- Build upon analysis from Story 1.1 reference implementation patterns
- Ensure compatibility with Go struct generation and JSON serialization
- Design for progressive complexity across template tiers
- Include proper validation constraints and documentation

**TypeSpec Imports and Decorators:**
```typescript
import "@typespec/http";
import "@typespec/rest";
import "@typespec/openapi3";

using TypeSpec.Http;
using TypeSpec.Rest;
```

**Validation Requirements:**
- All schemas must compile without errors using TypeSpec compiler
- Generated JSON Schema must validate against sample health responses
- OpenAPI v3 output must be valid and complete
- Schemas must support both Go and TypeScript code generation

**Integration Points:**
- Align with CloudEvents v1.0 specification for event schemas
- Support OpenTelemetry trace ID correlation in all models
- Include Server Timing API metadata in appropriate models
- Design for Kubernetes health probe compatibility

**Dependencies:**
- Completion of Story 1.1 (reference implementation analysis)
- TypeSpec compiler and tooling setup
- Understanding of JSON Schema and OpenAPI v3 requirements
- Knowledge of CloudEvents specification
