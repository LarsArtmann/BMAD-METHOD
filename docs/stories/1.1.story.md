# Story 1.1: Analyze Reference Health Implementation

## Status: Complete ✅

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to analyze the LarsArtmann/CV health.go implementation
- so that I can extract reusable patterns for TypeSpec definitions and understand proven health endpoint patterns

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Complete analysis document of LarsArtmann/CV health.go implementation with detailed breakdown of patterns
2. Identify key patterns for ServerTime API, error handling, and response structures
3. Document integration points for OpenTelemetry and Server Timing API
4. Create mapping between existing Go patterns and TypeSpec schema requirements
5. Document best practices and anti-patterns discovered in the reference implementation

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Decode and examine reference implementation structure (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Decode base64 content from GitHub API
  - [ ] Parse Go code structure and identify main components
  - [ ] Document health check types and constants
  - [ ] Identify core data structures (HealthReport, HealthCheck, etc.)
  - [ ] Create initial structure analysis document

- [ ] Task 2: Analyze health endpoint patterns and API design (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Document health check registration and execution patterns
  - [ ] Analyze individual check implementations (filesystem, memory, disk, database)
  - [ ] Extract error handling and status determination logic
  - [ ] Document response format and data structures
  - [ ] Identify extensibility patterns for custom checks

- [ ] Task 3: Extract ServerTime and performance monitoring patterns (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Analyze ServerTimeInfo structure and timestamp handling
  - [ ] Document timezone, UTC offset, and format conversion patterns
  - [ ] Extract performance metrics collection (MemoryMetrics, DiskMetrics)
  - [ ] Identify timing measurement utilities and patterns
  - [ ] Document system information gathering approaches

- [ ] Task 4: Map Go patterns to TypeSpec schema requirements (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create mapping table: Go types → TypeSpec models
  - [ ] Design TypeSpec interfaces for health endpoints
  - [ ] Plan JSON Schema generation strategy
  - [ ] Document validation and constraint requirements
  - [ ] Create TypeSpec import and decorator strategy

- [ ] Task 5: Create comprehensive analysis and recommendations (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Compile complete reference analysis document
  - [ ] Document best practices and anti-patterns discovered
  - [ ] Create TypeSpec schema design guidelines
  - [ ] Provide recommendations for four-tier template progression
  - [ ] Document integration strategy for observability features

## Dev Technical Guidance

**Reference Implementation Location:**
- Primary source: `LarsArtmann/CV@master/internal/health/health.go`
- Focus on ServerTime API patterns and health check implementations
- Pay special attention to OpenTelemetry integration patterns

**Key Analysis Areas:**
1. **Health Endpoint Structure**: Analyze the HTTP handler patterns, response formats, and error handling
2. **ServerTime Implementation**: Extract timestamp handling, timezone management, and format conversion patterns
3. **Observability Integration**: Document OpenTelemetry tracing, metrics collection, and Server Timing API usage
4. **Data Models**: Map existing Go structs to TypeSpec model requirements for schema generation

**TypeSpec Schema Considerations:**
- Document how Go types should map to TypeSpec models
- Identify required imports and decorators for HTTP endpoints
- Plan for JSON Schema and OpenAPI v3 generation requirements
- Consider CloudEvents integration patterns for future implementation

**Architecture Alignment:**
- Reference `docs/architecture.md#data-models--schemas` for target TypeSpec structure
- Align analysis with four-tier template progression (Basic → Enterprise)
- Consider progressive complexity requirements for different template tiers

**Output Requirements:**
- Create detailed analysis document in `docs/reference-analysis.md`
- Include code snippets and pattern examples
- Document decision rationale for TypeSpec schema design
- Provide clear mapping between reference implementation and target architecture

**Testing Strategy:**
- Validate analysis against actual reference implementation
- Test pattern extraction accuracy
- Verify TypeSpec mapping feasibility
- Validate observability integration approach

**Dependencies:**
- Access to LarsArtmann/CV repository
- Understanding of TypeSpec schema definition patterns
- Knowledge of OpenTelemetry Go SDK integration
- Familiarity with Server Timing API specification
