# Dynamic Feature Composition Architecture Implementation

## Objective
Implement a comprehensive dynamic feature composition system that allows users to build complex applications by combining modular features with automatic dependency resolution, conflict detection, and intelligent recommendations.

## Context
This prompt is designed for implementing plugin-like architecture where features can be dynamically composed, validated, and generated based on user requirements. The system should handle feature dependencies, conflicts, and provide intelligent recommendations.

## Task Description

### Phase 1: Core Architecture
1. **Feature Registry System**
   - Create `pkg/features/composition.go` with feature composer orchestration
   - Implement feature registration, discovery, and metadata management
   - Build dependency resolver with recursive dependency resolution
   - Create composition validator for conflict detection and compatibility checking

2. **Feature Implementation Framework**
   - Create `pkg/features/implementations.go` with concrete feature generators
   - Implement base feature generator interface with common functionality
   - Build feature-specific generators (health, observability, security, storage, API)
   - Create predefined feature catalog with tier-based compatibility

3. **Domain Architecture**
   - Implement `pkg/domain/entities.go` with DDD entities and aggregates
   - Create `pkg/domain/events.go` with comprehensive domain event system
   - Build `pkg/domain/repositories.go` with repository patterns and specifications
   - Design clean architecture boundaries with clear separation of concerns

### Phase 2: Feature Types to Implement
- **Health Features**: Basic, intermediate, advanced, enterprise tiers
- **Observability**: Metrics, tracing, logging, SRE monitoring
- **Security**: Basic auth, RBAC, enterprise security, compliance
- **Storage**: Database, cache, file storage with conflict resolution
- **API**: REST, GraphQL, gRPC with proper integration

### Phase 3: Intelligent Composition
1. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Automatic dependency discovery and installation
   - Circular dependency detection and prevention
   - Version compatibility checking and resolution
   - Optional dependency handling with user prompts

2. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Type-based conflict detection (e.g., multiple storage backends)
   - Explicit conflict declaration and handling
   - Resolution suggestions and automatic fixes
   - Graceful degradation strategies

3. **Feature Recommendations**
   - Tier-based feature suggestions
   - Complementary feature identification
   - Popular feature combinations
   - Performance and security best practices

### Phase 4: Generation Engine
1. **Parallel Generation**
   - Worker pool pattern for concurrent file generation
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Performance monitoring and optimization
   - Memory-efficient processing for large templates

2. **Template Integration**
   - Dynamic template selection based on features
   - Template variable processing and substitution
   - File merging and conflict resolution
   - Post-generation action execution

## Technical Requirements
- **Language**: Go with clean architecture principles
- **Performance**: Handle 50+ features with sub-second composition time
- **Concurrency**: Utilize goroutines for parallel processing
- **Memory**: Efficient memory usage for large feature sets
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Clear API documentation and usage examples

## Expected Deliverables
1. Feature composition engine with full dependency resolution
2. Predefined feature catalog with 20+ features across all tiers
3. Domain-driven design implementation with proper boundaries
4. Comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage
5. Integration with existing CLI and template system
6. Performance benchmarks and optimization

## Success Criteria
- Users can compose complex applications using simple feature selection
- Dependency conflicts are automatically detected and resolved
- Generation time scales linearly with feature complexity
- System provides intelligent recommendations based on user selections
- All generated code compiles and passes validation tests

## Notes
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing template system
- Follow established coding conventions and patterns
- Ensure enterprise-grade error handling and logging
- Design for extensibility to support future feature additions
