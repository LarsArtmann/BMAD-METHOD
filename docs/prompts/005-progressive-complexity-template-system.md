# Progressive Complexity Template System

## Prompt Name: Progressive Complexity Template System

## Description
Build template systems with multiple tiers of complexity, allowing users to start simple and upgrade as needs grow.

## When to Use
- Creating developer tools with different skill levels
- Building enterprise solutions with multiple deployment scenarios
- Need clear upgrade paths between feature sets
- Want to support both simple and complex use cases

## Prompt

```
Create a progressive complexity template system for [SYSTEM_NAME] with multiple tiers:

**Tier Structure:**
- **Basic Tier**: Simple, 5-minute deployment with core functionality
- **Intermediate Tier**: Production-ready, 15-minute deployment with monitoring
- **Advanced Tier**: Full observability, 30-minute deployment with enterprise features
- **Enterprise Tier**: Compliance-ready, 45-minute deployment with all features

**Template Architecture:**
- Shared core components across all tiers
- Progressive feature enablement
- Clear upgrade paths between tiers
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Configuration-driven tier selection

**Feature Progression:**
- Basic: Core functionality, simple health checks, basic deployment
- Intermediate: Dependency monitoring, basic observability, production configs
- Advanced: Full observability, event-driven patterns, performance monitoring
- Enterprise: Compliance features, advanced security, enterprise integrations

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Template inheritance and composition
- Feature flag-driven generation
- Tier-specific configuration validation
- Automated upgrade assistance
- Migration guides and tooling

**Quality Assurance:**
- Each tier must be fully functional
- Clear value proposition for each upgrade
- Comprehensive testing across all tiers
- Performance validation for deployment times
- User experience optimization

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Tier comparison matrix with features
- Clear upgrade decision trees
- Migration guides between tiers
- Best practices for each complexity level
- Troubleshooting guides

**Validation Framework:**
- Automated testing for all tiers
- Performance benchmarking
- Feature completeness validation
- Upgrade path testing
- User acceptance criteria

Build each tier incrementally, ensuring each works perfectly before moving to the next level of complexity.
```

## Expected Outcomes
- Multi-tier template system
- Clear progression paths
- Comprehensive documentation
- Automated validation
- User-friendly upgrade experience

## Success Criteria
- All tiers deploy within target timeframes
- Clear value differentiation between tiers
- Smooth upgrade paths work correctly
- Documentation enables self-service adoption
- Performance meets specified requirements
