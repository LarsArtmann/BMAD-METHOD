# Repository-Wide Documentation Analysis

## Prompt Name: Repository-Wide Documentation Analysis

## Context
You need to perform a comprehensive analysis of all documentation across an entire repository to understand the complete project scope, consolidate knowledge, and ensure no important information is overlooked.

## Objective
Conduct a systematic review of all repository documentation to:
- Understand the complete project landscape
- Identify knowledge gaps and inconsistencies
- Consolidate learnings and best practices
- Create comprehensive project guidelines
- Ensure knowledge preservation and transfer

## Analysis Scope

### 1. Documentation Inventory
**File Types to Analyze:**
- README files (main and subdirectory)
- Markdown documentation files (.md)
- Code comments and inline documentation
- Configuration files with documentation
- Template and example files
- Issue and pull request descriptions

**Directory Structure Review:**
- Root level documentation
- docs/ directory comprehensive review
- Project subdirectory documentation
- Hidden files and configuration documentation
- Generated documentation and artifacts

### 2. Content Analysis Framework
**Knowledge Categories:**
- **Project Vision and Objectives** - Goals, scope, and success criteria
- **Technical Architecture** - System design, patterns, and decisions
- **Implementation Details** - Code structure, patterns, and practices
- **Process and Methodology** - Workflows, procedures, and standards
- **Quality Assurance** - Testing, validation, and quality standards
- **User Guidance** - Setup, usage, and troubleshooting information

**Analysis Dimensions:**
- **Completeness** - Coverage of all necessary topics
- **Accuracy** - Correctness and currency of information
- **Consistency** - Alignment across different documents
- **Usability** - Clarity and actionability for target audiences
- **Maintainability** - Structure and organization for ongoing updates

### 3. Knowledge Extraction Process
**Information Gathering:**
- Read all documentation files systematically
- Extract key insights, decisions, and learnings
- Identify patterns, themes, and recurring concepts
- Note inconsistencies, gaps, and outdated information

**Knowledge Synthesis:**
- Organize information by category and importance
- Identify relationships and dependencies
- Consolidate overlapping or redundant information
- Extract actionable insights and recommendations

## Required Analysis Activities
