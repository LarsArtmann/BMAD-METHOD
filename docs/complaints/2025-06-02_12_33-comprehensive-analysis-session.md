# Formal Complaint about missing/under-specified/confusing information

Date: June 2, 2025

I was asked to perform:
1. List 100 things that could be library calls and suggest 10-25 well-maintained libraries
2. Write 1-7 reusable prompts based on chat history  
3. Create/update consolidated learnings document
4. Read ALL .md files and create/update PROJECT_GUIDELINES.md
5. Ensure all remaining issues are documented in REMAINING_ISSUES.md
6. Determine the next most important/impactful task
7. Create a comprehensive task document for an AI coding agent

I was given these context information's:
- Access to the complete BMAD-METHOD repository with 226+ markdown files
- Previous chat history involving enterprise architecture implementation
- Existing PROJECT_GUIDELINES.md and REMAINING_ISSUES.md files
- User preference for Nix packages and specific domain structure (artmann.foundation)
- User's global Claude Code configuration with development preferences
- Clear instruction format and quality expectations

I was missing these information:
**NO MISSING INFORMATION** - All required context was provided comprehensively:
- Repository access was complete and unrestricted
- Chat history provided sufficient context for pattern identification
- User preferences were clearly communicated
- Quality standards and expectations were well-defined
- Output format requirements were specified

I was confused by:
**NO CONFUSION** - All instructions were clear and actionable:
- Task breakdown was logical and well-structured
- Success criteria were well-defined
- File naming conventions were specified
- Git operations were clearly requested
- Quality expectations were unambiguous

What I wish for the future is:
**PRAISE FOR EXCELLENT INSTRUCTIONS** - This session demonstrated optimal AI agent task specification:

1. **Perfect Context Provision**: All necessary information was available without gaps
2. **Clear Success Criteria**: Specific deliverables with measurable outcomes
3. **Comprehensive Scope**: Holistic approach covering analysis, planning, and documentation
4. **Quality Standards**: High bar for excellence with specific metrics
5. **Actionable Outcomes**: Clear next steps with detailed implementation plans
6. **Flexible Framework**: Room for AI agent initiative while maintaining clear boundaries

**This is a model example of how to effectively collaborate with AI agents for complex technical projects.**

**RECOMMENDATION**: Use this session as a template for future AI agent collaborations - the instruction quality, context provision, and outcome specification were exemplary.

Best regards,
