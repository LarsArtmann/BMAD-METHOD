**Session**: Comprehensive Feature Composition and SRE Implementation  
**Duration**: Extended development session  
**Focus**: Enterprise-grade architecture, observability, and distribution strategy

## Executive Summary
This session involved implementing advanced enterprise-grade features including dynamic feature composition, comprehensive SRE observability stack, domain-driven design refactoring, and multi-platform distribution strategy. Key accomplishments include creating sophisticated architectural patterns and establishing production-ready deployment pipelines.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Dynamic Feature Composition Architecture
**Context**: Need for modular, composable feature system with intelligent dependency resolution  
**Implementation**: 
- Created `pkg/features/composition.go` with comprehensive feature orchestration
- Implemented `pkg/features/implementations.go` with concrete feature generators
- Built dependency resolver with conflict detection and resolution
- Established tier-based feature compatibility system

**Key Learnings**:
- **Plugin Architecture Complexity**: Implementing proper plugin systems requires careful interface design and version management
- **Dependency Resolution**: Circular dependency detection is crucial for complex feature systems
- **Conflict Management**: Type-based conflicts (e.g., multiple storage backends) need explicit handling
- **User Experience**: Feature recommendations based on project context significantly improve adoption

**Technical Patterns Learned**:
```go
// Feature composition with dependency resolution
type FeatureComposer struct {
    registry  *FeatureRegistry
    resolver  *DependencyResolver
    validator *CompositionValidator
    generator *CompositionGenerator
}

// Intelligent conflict resolution
func (cv *CompositionValidator) ValidateComposition(features []string, config *config.ProjectConfig) ([]ConflictInfo, []string, error)
```

### 2. Comprehensive SRE Observability Stack
**Context**: Enterprise-grade monitoring and reliability requirements  
**Implementation**:
- Created OpenTelemetry integration templates for metrics, tracing, and logging
- Implemented Prometheus alerting rules with SLO-based monitoring
- Built Grafana dashboards with tier-specific visualizations
- Established SLI/SLO configuration framework with error budget management

**Key Learnings**:
- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Structured approach to observability requires careful planning of metric dimensions and trace correlation
- **SRE Methodology**: Proper SLI/SLO implementation requires business alignment and clear error budget policies
- **Tier-Based Monitoring**: Different complexity tiers require appropriate observability complexity
- **Performance Impact**: Observability overhead must be minimized (<5% performance impact)

**Technical Patterns Learned**:
```go
// OpenTelemetry metrics with proper correlation
func (mp *MetricsProvider) RecordHTTPRequest(ctx context.Context, method, path string, statusCode int, duration time.Duration)

// SLO-based alerting with burn rate analysis
- alert: SLOErrorBudgetBurnRate
  expr: (1 - availability_sli) > 0.014  # 14x burn rate
```

### 3. Domain-Driven Design Implementation
**Context**: Need for clean architecture with proper domain modeling  
**Implementation**:
- Created `pkg/domain/entities.go` with comprehensive domain entities and aggregates
- Implemented `pkg/domain/events.go` with full domain event system
- Built `pkg/domain/repositories.go` with repository patterns and specifications
- Established clean architecture boundaries with proper separation

**Key Learnings**:
- **Aggregate Design**: Proper aggregate boundaries are crucial for maintaining consistency and performance
- **Event Sourcing**: Domain events provide excellent audit trails and enable eventual consistency
- **Repository Patterns**: Specification pattern enables complex queries while maintaining domain purity
- **Clean Architecture**: Dependency inversion is essential for testability and maintainability

**Technical Patterns Learned**:
```go
// Aggregate root with domain events
type BaseAggregateRoot struct {
    BaseEntity
    domainEvents []DomainEvent
    version      int
}

// Repository with specifications
type QueryRepository[T Entity] interface {
    Repository[T]
    FindBy(ctx context.Context, spec Specification[T]) ([]T, error)
}
```

### 4. Multi-Platform Distribution Strategy
**Context**: Need for single-line installation across all major platforms  
**Implementation**:
- Designed GitHub issue #2 with comprehensive packaging strategy
- Planned multi-platform binary distribution with smart installation
- Integrated Nix ecosystem support with flakes and derivations
- Established container and cloud-native deployment options

**Key Learnings**:
- **Installation Friction**: Single-line installation dramatically improves adoption rates
- **Package Manager Integration**: Supporting multiple package managers increases reach significantly
- **Nix Ecosystem**: Nix provides excellent reproducibility but requires specific implementation patterns
- **Container Strategy**: Multi-architecture container builds are essential for modern deployment

**Distribution Patterns Learned**:
```bash
# Universal installer pattern
curl -sSL https://install.artmann.foundation?repo=template-health | bash

# Nix flakes for reproducible builds
nix profile install github:LarsArtmann/BMAD-METHOD
```
