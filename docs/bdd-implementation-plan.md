```

### **Phase 2: Core Feature Scenarios (2 hours)**

#### **Task 2.1: Template Generation Features**
```gherkin
# features/template_generation.feature
Feature: Template Generation
  As a developer
  I want to generate projects from different template tiers
  So that I can choose the right complexity level for my needs

  Background:
    Given I have the template-health-endpoint CLI installed
    And I have cleaned up any existing test projects

  Scenario Outline: Generate project from different tiers
    When I run "template-health-endpoint generate --name <project_name> --tier <tier> --module github.com/test/<project_name>"
    Then a new project should be created in "./<project_name>"
    And the project should compile successfully
    And the project should have all required health endpoints
    And the health endpoints should respond correctly
    And the project should have <tier> tier features

    Examples:
      | project_name | tier         |
      | basic-test   | basic        |
      | inter-test   | intermediate |
      | adv-test     | advanced     |
      | ent-test     | enterprise   |

  Scenario: Generate project with custom configuration
    Given I want to customize my project generation
    When I run "template-health-endpoint generate --name custom-service --tier basic --module github.com/org/custom-service --features kubernetes,typescript"
    Then a new project should be created in "./custom-service"
    And the project should have Kubernetes manifests
    And the project should have TypeScript client
    And the project should compile successfully

  Scenario: Generate project with dry run
    When I run "template-health-endpoint generate --name my-service --tier basic --module github.com/org/my-service --dry-run"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should mention "dry run mode"
    And the output should show what would be generated
    And no project directory should be created
```

#### **Task 2.2: Static Template Features**
```gherkin
# features/static_templates.feature
Feature: Static Template Usage
  As a developer
  I want to use static templates directly
  So that I can manually customize templates before generation

  Scenario: List available templates
    When I run "template-health-endpoint template list"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should list "basic" template
    And the output should list "intermediate" template
    And the output should list "advanced" template
    And the output should list "enterprise" template
    And each template should show its description and features

  Scenario: Validate all templates
    When I run "template-health-endpoint template validate"
    Then the command should succeed
    And all templates should pass structure validation
    And all templates should pass metadata validation
    And the output should confirm "All templates are valid"

  Scenario: Generate from static template
    When I run "template-health-endpoint template from-static --name static-test --tier basic --module github.com/test/static-test"
    Then a new project should be created in "./static-test"
    And the project should have proper template variable substitution
    And the project should compile successfully
    And all health endpoints should work correctly
```

#### **Task 2.3: Project Migration Features**
```gherkin
# features/project_migration.feature
Feature: Project Migration Between Tiers
  As a developer
  I want to migrate my project between template tiers
  So that I can add more features as my service evolves

  Background:
    Given I have a basic tier project called "migration-test"
    And the project is compiled and working
    And all basic health endpoints are responding

  Scenario: Migrate from basic to intermediate
    When I run "template-health-endpoint migrate --project ./migration-test --to intermediate"
    Then the migration should succeed
    And the project should be at intermediate tier
    And the project should have dependency health check files
    And the project should have basic OpenTelemetry configuration
    And the project should still compile successfully
    And all original endpoints should still work
    And new dependency endpoints should be available

  Scenario: Migrate with dry run shows plan
    When I run "template-health-endpoint migrate --project ./migration-test --to advanced --dry-run"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should show "Migration plan: basic -> advanced"
    And the output should list files that would be added
    And the output should list files that would be modified
    And the output should mention "dry run mode"
    And the project should remain unchanged

  Scenario: Progressive migration path
    Given I have migrated the project to intermediate tier
    When I run "template-health-endpoint migrate --project ./migration-test --to advanced"
    Then the migration should succeed
    And the project should have CloudEvents integration
    And the project should have Server Timing headers
    And the project should have full OpenTelemetry configuration
    When I run "template-health-endpoint migrate --project ./migration-test --to enterprise"
    Then the migration should succeed
    And the project should have mTLS configuration
    And the project should have compliance logging
    And the project should have multi-environment configs
```

### **Phase 3: Error Handling and Edge Cases (1 hour)**

#### **Task 3.1: Error Scenario Testing**
```gherkin
# features/error_handling.feature
Feature: Error Handling and Validation
  As a developer
  I want clear error messages when something goes wrong
  So that I can quickly understand and fix issues

  Scenario: Generate with invalid tier
    When I run "template-health-endpoint generate --name test --tier invalid --module github.com/test/test"
    Then the command should fail with exit code 1
    And the error message should contain "invalid tier 'invalid'"
    And the error message should list available tiers: "basic, intermediate, advanced, enterprise"
    And the error message should suggest "Use 'template-health-endpoint template list' to see all templates"

  Scenario: Generate with missing required flags
    When I run "template-health-endpoint generate --name test"
    Then the command should fail with exit code 1
    And the error message should contain "required flag"
    And the error message should mention "--module is required"

  Scenario: Generate with invalid module path
    When I run "template-health-endpoint generate --name test --tier basic --module invalid-module-path"
    Then the command should fail with exit code 1
    And the error message should contain "invalid Go module path"

  Scenario: Migrate non-existent project
    When I run "template-health-endpoint migrate --project ./nonexistent --to intermediate"
    Then the command should fail with exit code 1
    And the error message should contain "project not found"
    And the error message should suggest checking the project path

  Scenario: Migrate with invalid tier transition
    Given I have a basic tier project called "invalid-migration-test"
    When I run "template-health-endpoint migrate --project ./invalid-migration-test --to invalid"
    Then the command should fail with exit code 1
    And the error message should contain "invalid tier 'invalid'"
    And the error message should list valid migration targets

  Scenario: Template validation with corrupted template
    Given I have corrupted the basic template metadata
    When I run "template-health-endpoint template validate"
    Then the command should fail with exit code 1
    And the error message should identify the corrupted template
    And the error message should describe the validation error
```

### **Phase 4: Performance and Integration Testing (1 hour)**

#### **Task 4.1: Performance Requirements**
```gherkin
# features/performance.feature
Feature: Performance Requirements
  As a developer
  I want the CLI to perform efficiently
  So that it doesn't slow down my development workflow

  Scenario: CLI commands complete quickly
    When I run "template-health-endpoint template list"
    Then the command should complete in less than 2 seconds

  Scenario: Project generation is reasonably fast
    When I run "template-health-endpoint generate --name perf-test --tier basic --module github.com/test/perf-test"
    Then the command should complete in less than 10 seconds
    And a working project should be created

  Scenario: Generated service handles concurrent requests
    Given I have a running basic tier service
    When I send 50 concurrent requests to "/health"
    Then all requests should return status 200
    And the average response time should be less than 100ms
    And no requests should fail

  Scenario: Template validation is fast
    When I run "template-health-endpoint template validate"
    Then the command should complete in less than 5 seconds
    And all templates should be validated
```

#### **Task 4.2: Kubernetes Integration**
```gherkin
# features/kubernetes_integration.feature
Feature: Kubernetes Integration
  As a DevOps engineer
  I want generated projects to work seamlessly with Kubernetes
  So that I can deploy them in production environments

  Background:
    Given I have kubectl available
    And I have a test Kubernetes namespace

  Scenario: Generated Kubernetes manifests are valid
    Given I have generated a basic tier project called "k8s-test"
    When I validate the Kubernetes manifests with "kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f deployments/kubernetes/"
    Then all manifests should be valid YAML
    And kubectl should report no validation errors

  Scenario: Health probes are properly configured
    Given I have generated an intermediate tier project called "k8s-health-test"
    When I examine the deployment manifest
    Then the liveness probe should point to "/health/live"
    And the readiness probe should point to "/health/ready"
    And the startup probe should point to "/health/startup"
    And all probes should have appropriate timeouts and intervals

  Scenario: Service discovery works correctly
    Given I have deployed a generated project to Kubernetes
    When I check the service endpoints
    Then the service should be accessible within the cluster
    And health endpoints should respond correctly
    And the service should be marked as ready
```

### **Phase 5: Advanced Scenarios (1 hour)**

#### **Task 5.1: Template Customization**
```gherkin
# features/template_customization.feature
Feature: Template Customization
  As a developer
  I want to customize templates for my organization's needs
  So that generated projects follow our standards

  Scenario: Interactive template customization
    Given I want to customize a template interactively
    When I run "template-health-endpoint customize --tier basic --interactive"
    Then I should be prompted for customization options
    And I should be able to specify custom features
    And I should be able to save my customization profile
    And the customized template should generate correctly

  Scenario: Use saved customization profile
    Given I have a saved customization profile called "my-org"
    When I run "template-health-endpoint customize --tier basic --profile my-org"
    Then the template should be customized according to the profile
    And the generated project should include organization-specific configurations

  Scenario: Batch customization with config file
    Given I have a customization config file "custom.yaml"
    When I run "template-health-endpoint customize --tier advanced --config custom.yaml"
    Then the template should be customized according to the config file
    And the generated project should reflect all customizations
```

#### **Task 5.2: Update and Maintenance**
```gherkin
# features/project_updates.feature
Feature: Project Updates and Maintenance
  As a developer
  I want to update my existing projects to newer template versions
  So that I can benefit from improvements and security updates

  Scenario: Update project to newer template version
    Given I have a basic tier project at version "1.0.0"
    And a newer template version "1.1.0" is available
    When I run "template-health-endpoint update --project ./my-project --template-version 1.1.0"
    Then the project should be updated to version "1.1.0"
    And new features should be available
    And existing functionality should remain intact
    And the project should still compile and run

  Scenario: Selective update of project components
    Given I have an intermediate tier project
    When I run "template-health-endpoint update --project ./my-project --selective kubernetes,docs"
    Then only Kubernetes manifests should be updated
    And only documentation should be updated
    And source code should remain unchanged
    And the project should still work correctly

  Scenario: Update with conflict resolution
    Given I have a modified basic tier project
    And I have made custom changes to health handlers
    When I run "template-health-endpoint update --project ./my-project --template-version 1.1.0"
    Then the update should detect conflicts
    And I should be prompted for conflict resolution
    And I should be able to choose how to handle each conflict
    And the final project should work correctly
```
