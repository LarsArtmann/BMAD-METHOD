# Project Brief: template-health-endpoint

## Introduction / Problem Statement

The modern microservices ecosystem lacks standardized, comprehensive health endpoint templates that provide both basic functionality and enterprise-grade observability. Developers repeatedly implement health checks from scratch, leading to inconsistent implementations, missing observability features, and poor integration with modern cloud-native infrastructure.

This project addresses the critical need for a comprehensive template repository that generates TypeSpec-based health endpoint APIs with automatic JSON Schema & OpenAPI v3 generation, Go code generation, OpenTelemetry integration, and CloudEvents support. The solution will provide tiered templates from basic health checks to enterprise-grade monitoring solutions.

## Vision & Goals

- **Vision:** Establish the industry standard for health endpoint implementation by providing comprehensive, TypeSpec-driven templates that seamlessly integrate with modern observability and cloud-native ecosystems.

- **Primary Goals:**
  - Goal 1: Create a comprehensive template repository with 4 tiers (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Enterprise) of health endpoint implementations
  - Goal 2: Implement TypeSpec-first approach with automatic generation of JSON Schema, OpenAPI v3, Go code, and TypeScript types
  - Goal 3: Integrate native OpenTelemetry instrumentation and Server Timing API support across all templates
  - Goal 4: Provide Kubernetes-ready configurations with health probes, ServiceMonitor, and Ingress templates
  - Goal 5: Enable CloudEvents-driven health monitoring for event-driven architectures

- **Success Metrics (Initial Ideas):**
  - Template adoption rate (GitHub stars, forks, downloads)
  - Time-to-deployment reduction (target: 5 minutes for basic, 30 minutes for enterprise)
  - Community contributions and template variations
  - Integration success rate with major observability platforms (Prometheus, Jaeger, Grafana)
  - Kubernetes ecosystem compatibility validation

## Target Audience / Users

**Primary Users:**
- **Backend Developers**: Need quick, reliable health endpoint implementations for microservices
- **DevOps Engineers**: Require Kubernetes-ready health monitoring with observability integration
- **Platform Engineers**: Building internal developer platforms and need standardized health endpoints
- **Enterprise Architects**: Need compliance-ready, enterprise-grade health monitoring solutions

**Secondary Users:**
- **Frontend Developers**: Benefit from generated TypeScript types and client SDKs
- **SRE Teams**: Leverage comprehensive observability and event-driven monitoring capabilities
- **Open Source Community**: Contributors and users of TypeSpec-based API development

## Key Features / Scope (High-Level Ideas for MVP)

**Core Template Generation System:**
- Go-based template generator with TypeSpec processing
- Four-tier template hierarchy (Basic → Intermediate → Advanced → Enterprise)
- Automatic schema and code generation pipeline

**Template Tier Value Proposition:**
- **Basic Tier**: Quick start (5 minutes) - Simple `/health` endpoint with status + ServerTime API (`/health/time`)
- **Intermediate Tier**: Production ready (15 minutes) - Adds dependency checks, readiness/liveness probes, basic OpenTelemetry
- **Advanced Tier**: Full observability (30 minutes) - Complete OpenTelemetry integration, Server Timing API, CloudEvents
- **Enterprise Tier**: Compliance ready (45 minutes) - Kubernetes manifests, ServiceMonitor, compliance features

**ServerTime API Specification (`/health/time`):**
- RFC3339 timestamp with timezone information
- Unix timestamps (seconds and milliseconds)
- ISO 8601 formatted timestamp
- Human-readable formatted time
- Server Timing API metrics for response performance
- OpenTelemetry trace ID correlation

**TypeSpec-First Development:**
- Comprehensive TypeSpec definitions for all health API models
- Automatic JSON Schema generation for validation
- OpenAPI v3 specification generation for documentation
- Go struct and handler generation from schemas

**Observability Integration:**
- Native OpenTelemetry instrumentation (traces, metrics, logs)
- Server Timing API integration for performance metrics
- CloudEvents support for health status change events
- Prometheus metrics exposition and ServiceMonitor templates

**Kubernetes Integration:**
- Health probe configurations (liveness, readiness, startup)
- Service discovery and load balancer integration
- Ingress routing and OpenTelemetry Collector configuration

## Post MVP Features / Scope and Ideas

**Advanced Monitoring & Analytics:**
- Custom health check plugin system
- Performance degradation detection and alerting
- Historical health data analysis and trending
- Multi-region health status aggregation

**Enterprise & Compliance Features:**
- SOC2, HIPAA, PCI compliance templates
- Advanced security features (authentication, rate limiting, audit logging)
- Service mesh integration (Istio, Linkerd)
- Multi-environment configuration management

**Extended Language Support (Future):**
- Additional language support to be evaluated post-MVP
- Focus remains on Go and TypeScript only for initial release

**Advanced Event-Driven Features:**
- Event sourcing for health status history
- CQRS patterns for health data management
- Saga patterns for orchestrated health check workflows
- Real-time health status streaming

**Developer Experience Enhancements:**
- VS Code extension for template generation
- CLI tool for project scaffolding
- Interactive web-based template configurator
- Integration with popular development frameworks

## Known Technical Constraints or Preferences

**Constraints:**
- Must use TypeSpec as the primary API definition language
- **ONLY Go and TypeScript support** - no Python, Rust, or other languages for MVP
- Must integrate with existing template system architecture
- Timeline: 4 weeks for complete implementation
- Must be compatible with Kubernetes ecosystem standards
- OpenTelemetry integration is mandatory, not optional
- CloudEvents support is required for event-driven architecture
- Server Timing API integration is critical requirement

**Initial Architectural Preferences:**
- **Repository Structure**: Standalone template repository with clear separation of template tiers
- **Service Architecture**: Template-generated microservices with cloud-native patterns
- **Build System**: Go-based generator with npm scripts for TypeScript components
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive markdown documentation with interactive examples
- **Testing Strategy**: Automated validation for TypeSpec, generated code, and Kubernetes manifests

**Risks:**
- TypeSpec ecosystem maturity and tooling stability
- Complexity of maintaining four different template tiers
- Integration challenges with diverse observability platforms
- Kubernetes API version compatibility across different clusters
- CloudEvents specification evolution and breaking changes

**User Preferences:**
- Reference implementation from LarsArtmann/CV health.go should be used as foundation
- Server Timing API integration is critical for performance monitoring (https://web.dev/articles/custom-metrics?utm_source=devtools#server-timing-api)
- CloudEvents support is essential (https://cloudevents.io/)
- Native OpenTelemetry support is mandatory
- Templates must be production-ready, not just proof-of-concept
- Documentation must include best practices and architectural guidance
- Clear value proposition for template tiers (basic vs intermediate vs advanced vs enterprise)
- Kubernetes integration must work with existing standards and tools

## Relevant Research (Optional)

**Reference Implementation Analysis:**
- Primary reference: `LarsArtmann/CV@master/internal/health/health.go` provides excellent foundation with ServerTime API support, clean Go implementation, RESTful design, and proper error handling

**Technology Stack Research:**
- TypeSpec ecosystem evaluation for API-first development
- OpenTelemetry Go SDK integration patterns and best practices
- CloudEvents Go SDK implementation strategies
- Kubernetes health probe configuration standards
- Server Timing API browser DevTools integration capabilities

**Competitive Analysis:**
- Existing health endpoint libraries and their limitations
- Enterprise monitoring solution integration patterns
- Cloud provider health check service offerings
- Open source template repository success patterns
