# BMAD Method: Complete Template Health Endpoint System

## 🎯 **Task Overview**

**Objective**: Complete the template-health-endpoint project using the BMAD Method (Business, Management, Architecture, Development) to deliver a production-ready template system that fulfills all GitHub issue #127 requirements.

**Current State**: 75% complete - We have basic, intermediate, advanced, and partial enterprise tiers, but need to properly apply BMAD Method structure and complete remaining features.

**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - This task demonstrates the BMAD Method effectiveness and completes the original project requirements.

## 📊 **BMAD Method Application**

### **B - BUSINESS (Value & Requirements)**

#### **Business Problem**
Developers spend hours setting up health endpoint infrastructure for microservices, leading to:
- Inconsistent health check implementations
- Missing observability features
- Poor Kubernetes integration
- Lack of progressive complexity options

#### **Business Solution**
Template repository providing:
- **5-minute setup** for basic health endpoints
- **Progressive complexity** (Basic → Intermediate → Advanced → Enterprise)
- **Production-ready** templates with best practices
- **Dual-purpose system** (static templates + CLI tool)

#### **Business Value**
- **Time Savings**: Reduce setup from hours to minutes
- **Consistency**: Standardized health endpoint patterns
- **Quality**: Production-ready templates with testing
- **Scalability**: Clear upgrade path as services mature

#### **Success Metrics**
- All 4 template tiers generate working projects
- Generated projects compile and run successfully
- All health endpoints respond correctly
- Kubernetes deployments work properly
- User can progress from basic to enterprise tier

```gherkin
# features/template_generation.feature
Feature: Template Generation
  As a developer
  I want to generate projects from different template tiers
  So that I can choose the right complexity level for my needs

  Scenario Outline: Generate project from different tiers
    When I run "template-health-endpoint generate --name <project_name> --tier <tier>"
    Then a new project should be created
    And the project should compile successfully
    And all health endpoints should respond correctly
```

**Task 3.2: Migration BDD Scenarios**
```gherkin
# features/project_migration.feature
Feature: Project Migration Between Tiers
  As a developer
  I want to migrate my project between template tiers
  So that I can add more features as my service evolves

  Scenario: Migrate from basic to intermediate
    Given I have a basic tier project
    When I run "template-health-endpoint migrate --to intermediate"
    Then the project should be upgraded to intermediate tier
    And dependency health check endpoints should be available

## 📚 **Context and Background**

### **Why BMAD Method Matters Here**
This project is an ideal demonstration of the BMAD Method because:

1. **Business**: Clear value proposition (time savings, consistency)
2. **Management**: Complex project with multiple epics and stories
3. **Architecture**: Technical decisions impact user experience
4. **Development**: Implementation quality affects business outcomes

### **Current BMAD Method Application Status**
- **Business (B)**: ✅ Well-defined value proposition and success metrics
- **Management (M)**: 🔄 Partial - epics defined but not all stories complete
- **Architecture (A)**: 🔄 Partial - good foundation but missing enterprise features
- **Development (D)**: 🔄 Partial - good quality but missing advanced CLI and BDD testing

### **BMAD Method Success Indicators**
- Each phase delivers measurable business value
- Management structure enables clear progress tracking
- Architecture decisions support business requirements
- Development quality ensures reliable business outcomes
