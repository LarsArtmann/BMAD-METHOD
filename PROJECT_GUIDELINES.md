## Dual Template System Guidelines

### Core Architecture Principle

**Always design template systems to serve both manual and automated workflows:**
- **Static Templates**: Provide copyable template directories for manual customization
- **CLI Tools**: Provide programmatic generation and update capabilities
- **Integration**: Ensure both approaches work seamlessly together

### Repository Structure Standard

Follow established template-* repository patterns:
```
template-{name}/
├── templates/           # Static template directories
│   ├── basic/          # Users can copy these directly
│   ├── intermediate/   # Production-ready template
│   ├── advanced/       # Full observability template
│   └── enterprise/     # Kubernetes & compliance template
├── examples/            # Generated examples from templates
├── scripts/             # Template operations
├── cmd/                 # CLI tool
│   └── generator/
├── pkg/                 # Core logic
└── docs/                # Documentation
```

### Template Variable Processing

**Process template variables comprehensively across all relevant file types:**
- **File Types**: `.tmpl`, `.go`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.json`, `.ts`, `.sh`, `go.mod`, `README.md`
- **Variables**: Use Go template syntax with clear, descriptive names
- **Validation**: Ensure all variables are properly substituted

### Template Metadata Management

**Include structured metadata for each template tier:**
```yaml
name: basic
description: Basic tier health endpoint template
tier: basic
features:
  kubernetes: true
  typescript: true
  docker: true
  opentelemetry: false
  cloudevents: false
version: "1.0.0"
```

### CLI Command Structure

**Use hierarchical command structure for complex template operations:**
```bash
tool-name generate          # Generate new project (embedded templates)
tool-name template list     # List available static templates
tool-name template from-static  # Generate from static template
tool-name template validate # Validate template integrity
tool-name update            # Update existing project
tool-name migrate           # Migrate between tiers
```

### Progressive Complexity Design

**Design template tiers with clear progression:**
- **Basic**: Core functionality, minimal dependencies
- **Intermediate**: Production features, basic observability
- **Advanced**: Full observability, event-driven features
- **Enterprise**: Compliance, security, multi-environment support

### Template Quality Standards

**Comprehensive Testing Strategy:**
- Template Validation: Structure, metadata, required files
- Generation Testing: Templates generate working projects
- Compilation Testing: Generated projects compile successfully
- Runtime Testing: Generated applications work correctly
- Integration Testing: End-to-end workflow validation

**User Experience Standards:**
- Progress indicators during generation
- Clear success confirmation with next steps
- Actionable error messages
- Comprehensive help text and examples

## Issue Alignment and Requirement Validation

### Critical Importance of Requirement Analysis

**Always validate current work against original requirements:**
- **Read Complete Issues**: Always read the entire original issue including all comments and related issues
- **Use GitHub API**: Programmatically fetch issues to ensure complete context
- **Periodic Validation**: Regularly validate current work against original requirements
- **Document Gaps**: Clearly document any deviations with justification

### Requirement Validation Process

```bash
# Use GitHub API to fetch original issue
gh api repos/owner/repo/issues/123 > original-issue.json
gh api repos/owner/repo/issues/123/comments > issue-comments.json

# Document analysis
echo "Original Requirements:" > requirements-analysis.md
echo "Current Implementation:" >> requirements-analysis.md
echo "Gaps Identified:" >> requirements-analysis.md
echo "Alignment Strategy:" >> requirements-analysis.md
```

### Course Correction Strategy

**When misalignment is discovered:**
1. **Assess Impact**: Determine scope of required changes
2. **Preserve Value**: Identify valuable work that can be adapted
3. **Plan Restructuring**: Design minimal changes to meet requirements
4. **Communicate Changes**: Update stakeholders on scope/timeline adjustments
5. **Implement Systematically**: Execute realignment with proper testing

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Original issue read completely including all comments
- [ ] Related issues reviewed and understood
- [ ] Current implementation audited against requirements
- [ ] Gaps identified and prioritized
- [ ] Alignment strategy documented and approved
- [ ] Stakeholder expectations reset if needed

## Development Principles

### Incremental Development Approach

**5-Change Rule**: Each story must have exactly 5 focused changes:
1. Each change should be completable in 10-15 minutes
2. Focus on single responsibility per change
3. Include testing and validation in each change
4. Document rationale for complex decisions
5. Maintain working state after each change

**Quality First Approach**:
- "Keep going until everything works and you think you did a great job"
- Validate each change before proceeding
- Test in real environments, not just theory
- Ensure production-ready quality at each step

### Schema-First Development

For API and data-driven projects:
1. **Define Schemas First**: Use TypeSpec, JSON Schema, or similar for API definitions
2. **Generate Code**: Use schema-driven code generation for consistency
3. **Multi-Language Support**: Generate clients and servers from single schema
4. **Validation Integration**: Include schema validation in generated code
5. **Documentation Generation**: Auto-generate API documentation from schemas

**Benefits**: Ensures consistency, reduces errors, enables multi-language support

### Progressive Complexity Implementation

For systems with multiple use cases:
1. **Tier Structure**: Design Basic → Intermediate → Advanced → Enterprise tiers
2. **Clear Value Proposition**: Each tier should provide obvious value over previous
3. **Feature Flags**: Use configuration-driven feature enablement
4. **Upgrade Paths**: Provide clear migration between tiers
5. **Time Targets**: Set realistic deployment time goals for each tier

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Start with simplest tier that provides value
- Build complexity incrementally
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Test upgrade paths thoroughly

## Template Development Standards

### Template Conversion Process

**Systematic Approach for Converting CLI-Embedded Templates to Static Templates:**

1. **Extract**: Generate projects using existing CLI/templates
2. **Convert**: Replace hardcoded values with template variables
   ```bash
   # Example conversion
   sed -e 's/hardcoded-name/{{.Config.Name}}/g' \
       -e 's/hardcoded-module/{{.Config.GoModule}}/g'
   ```
3. **Validate**: Ensure templates work correctly
4. **Document**: Add metadata and documentation
5. **Test**: Comprehensive testing of generated projects

### Template Variable Standards

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use descriptive, clear variable names: `{{.Config.Name}}` not `{{.N}}`
- Follow consistent naming patterns: `{{.Config.GoModule}}`, `{{.Config.Description}}`
- Group related variables logically under namespaces
- Provide sensible defaults where possible

**Processing Requirements:**
```go
// Check if file needs template processing
if filepath.Ext(inputPath) == ".tmpl" ||
   filepath.Base(inputPath) == "go.mod" ||
   filepath.Base(inputPath) == "README.md" ||
   filepath.Ext(inputPath) == ".go" ||
   filepath.Ext(inputPath) == ".yaml" ||
   filepath.Ext(inputPath) == ".yml" ||
   filepath.Ext(inputPath) == ".json" ||
   filepath.Ext(inputPath) == ".ts" ||
   filepath.Ext(inputPath) == ".sh" {
    // Process as template with variable substitution
} else {
    // Copy file as-is
}
```

### CLI Development Standards

**Command Structure:**
- Use established CLI frameworks (Cobra for Go)
- Implement hierarchical command structure for complex operations
- Provide comprehensive help text and examples
- Support both interactive and non-interactive modes
- Include dry-run options for safe testing

**Error Handling:**
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Include context about what went wrong and how to fix it
- Validate inputs early and provide immediate feedback
- Log detailed information for debugging while keeping user output clean

**User Experience:**
```
🚀 Generating project from basic template...
📋 Using template: Basic tier health endpoint template (1.0.0)
✅ Successfully generated project from basic template!
📁 Project created in: my-project
```

### Template Quality Assurance

---

## Final Completion Guidelines

### Completion-Driven Development

**Core Principle**: Fix critical issues and achieve 100% success before adding new features.

#### Systematic Debugging Methodology
1. **Run Integration Tests**: Identify specific failures
2. **Check Compilation**: Find exact compilation errors
3. **Locate Template Source**: Find the template causing issues
4. **Fix Precisely**: Remove only unused imports, fix only broken logic
5. **Validate Immediately**: Test fix before moving to next issue
6. **Comprehensive Retest**: Ensure no regressions

#### Template Import Management
**Critical Learning**: Go import management in templates requires precise understanding.

```go
// ✅ Correct: Only import what's directly used
import (
    "net/http"      // Used for http.Handler, http.Request
    "strings"       // Used for strings.HasPrefix()
)

// ❌ Incorrect: Including unused imports
import (
    "encoding/json"  // Not used - struct tags don't require import
    "fmt"           // Not used - no fmt function calls
    "context"       // Not used - r.Context() doesn't require import
)
```

**Rules**:
- Struct tags like `json:"field"` do NOT require importing the package
- Method calls like `r.Context()` do NOT require importing the package
- Only direct function calls require package imports

#### Integration Test Reality Alignment
**Principle**: Tests must validate actual generation output, not assumed output.

```bash
# ✅ Good: Test actual generated structure
if [[ -f "project/internal/security/rbac.go" && \
      -f "project/internal/security/mtls.go" ]]; then
    log_success "Enterprise structure correct"
fi

# ❌ Bad: Test for files that aren't generated
if [[ -f "project/configs/development.yaml" ]]; then
    log_success "Config files present"  # May not exist
fi
```

#### Quality Metrics for Completion
- **Test Success Rate**: 100% of integration tests must pass
- **Compilation Success**: All generated projects compile without warnings
- **Runtime Validation**: Generated applications start and respond correctly
- **Performance**: Generation completes in under 5 seconds per tier

### Enterprise Template Complexity

#### Progressive Feature Enhancement
```yaml
# Feature matrix for multi-tier systems
feature_matrix:
  basic:
    core_api: true
    health_checks: basic
    docker: true
